#Organization

[we are talking about the organization of the campaign here, not the structure of the group running the campaign]

* Articulate the goal, it could be lofty or even a little fuzzy
   * is it a very specific goal? or a general state? 
  
* Figure out what's needed to get to that goal
   * mozilize (mobilize, actually) lots of people? 
   * access to decision-makers
   * education, awareness
  
* Define your audience

* Evaluate the ecosystem
   * what are others doing?
   * are they potential partners?
   * who can reach the critical audience well? 
   * is there something special this group can bring to the effort?

* Sustainability of the effort
   * how long is the campaign?
   * how committed are the leaders?  And are they committed to a specific goal, or more a change of state? 
   * are there ways people can have an ebb-and-flow of effort to avoid burnout?
   * how to get the most efficient use of people's time and focus?
   * have different levels of engagement
   * develop new generations of leaders for long-term campaigns
  
* Develop support systems for people leading the campaign
   * the weight of the campaign can be large; and you may hear a lot more problems
   * are the leaders staying open to new ideas, and increasing effectiveness? 

* List the potential tactics 

* Test, iterate, develop a feedback loop re effectiveness of the tactics
