#Decision-making

There are at least two popular aproaches:
* Do-ocracy is an organizational way where every individual chooses own role and/or task and does it autonomously or in a team. But accountability sticks to actor who implement task/role but not who is officially assigned. 
  * The main advantages of this approach: big motivation and rapid implementation. 
  * Disadvantages are burn out of team core.
* Consensus is an organizational approach where decisions are made by agreement of a whole group of actors. 
  * Benefits are sustainibility and deep understanding tack and roles by each member of collective. 
  * Drawbacks: Very time consuming and not flexible. 

**Option: The better way is to combine the methods.
